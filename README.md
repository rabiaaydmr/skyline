# skyline
The İstanbul skyline problem, often mistakenly called the New York skyline problem, is the problem of drawing the skyline of a city given a set of buildings of that city. In this homework you will write a program whose input is a list of the locations and sizes of buildings, and whose output is a description of the visible skyline, that is, how the city looks as an outline, when viewed from a distance.   For a real-life version of this problem, go to Vaniköy on the Asian side of the Bosphorus, and, as you sip your tea, contemplate on how the skyline will look as the sun sets over the European side.
